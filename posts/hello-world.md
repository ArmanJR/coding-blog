`Hello World!` this is my first blog post on this new platform `CODEDOC`. I'm so excited to write posts here cause I think this platform can be an awesome alternative to Medium. Medium is not bad at all, but programmers and developers have a lot of difficulties using it because if it's poor support for source codes and code-based blog posts. So here we go!

First I'm going to introduce myself a bit. I'm Arman Jafarnezhad, also known as Junior. I was born in May 11th, 1998. 14 years later, I got a 2 out of 20 in my first-ever programming exam. With this poor result, it's a terrible idea to continue to learn coding, right? but I did (I make terrible decisions every day). So I learned C++ and built a few [cool projects](http://cppapps.blog.ir/category/C-Graphics/). Then the journey of web development began when I was 15 years old. Until now, my main focus has been web development, specifically back-end. My first semi-big project was [Termustat](http://termustat.ir), an online scheduling web app for university students in Iran. Termustat now supports 3 universities, 38 faculties and has over 2k active users.

Besides back-end web development & PHP, I have experience in many other technologies and programming languages. Python, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, and Swift were my favorites.
My main focus these days is data science and machine learning solutions. I'm currently a senior computer science student and actively reading new ML & deep learning papers. I'm looking forward to being a data scientist in the future.
